## Overview

### To provide a more in depth analysis of the data for UFO sightings by providing tools to filter the data by date, city, state, country and the shape of the sighted UFO.

## Results

## Summary

### The website does a great job of providing with easy to use tools to filter the data using different criteria. However, the filter only works if the values for search are entered exactly how they appear on the table. For example, if one wanted to search for all the sighting in the state of North Carolina, spelling it out as such did not yield any results. Results appeared only when "nc" was entered in the state field.
